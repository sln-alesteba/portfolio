                My name is Alberto Esteban, I'm from Logroño, La Rioja a small city in northern Spain. 
                I'm software engineer currently studying a masters in Data Science. 
                I've always been very curious about coding and I've developed a special interest in computer graphics. 
                Right now I'm focusing on learning new things about machine and deep learning, especially from the data architecture perspective.
                (because I belive is pretty similar to the rendering engine pipelines I now.)

    <p>Graphics Library vs Rendering Engine</p>

    <p>OpenGL is a graphics library with many functions for drawing complex geometries based on more simple geometry primitives such as points, lines and triangles. 
  A rendering engine is a well defined framework that uses some of the graphics library functions to deliver a simple way to construct 3d scenes. 
  In order to understand the rendering engine architecture, lets have a grasp of what a graphics pipeline looks like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphics Pipeline</p>

    <p>The graphics pipeline is the process of turning a 3D model into what the computer displays in the 2D screen.
  The pipeline has the following stages:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>application: is executed by the software on the main processor, the CPU, initializing the window where graphics will be displayed during the following steps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>geometry: determining the position of each vertex of the geometric shapes that need to be rendered, implemented by a program called a vertex shader.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>rasterization: establish the relationship between screen pixels and geometric shapes. It is responsible for the majority of the operations with polygons and their vertices</p>

        <p>It can be divided in the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>[start] in: object coordinates</li>
          <li>Model &amp; Camera transformations:</li>
          <li>Lighting</li>
          <li>Projection</li>
          <li>Clipping</li>
          <li>Window - view port transformation</li>
          <li>[end] out: device (screen) coordinates</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>pixel processing: associates each pixel in the render image with a color, involves a program called fragment shader.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scene Tree</p>

    <p>Prior to any of the rendering steps mentioned before, the rendering engine has to work with some abstract representation of a 3D-scene.
  This scene is sometimes structured as a tree since it’s simple to calculate complex transformations applied to object hierarchies.</p>

    <p>Within this hierarchy each of the 3D objects must store the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>matrix for its local transformation</li>
      <li>lis of references to child objects</li>
      <li>reference to a parent object</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notice that within the same class, a full tree structure has beend defined. Some of the functions this ‘gameObject’ class needs to have are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>add / remove to manage child / parent objects</li>
      <li>worldMatrix to calculate the global position</li>
      <li>getChildren to convert the scene tree to a list</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With this simple ingridients the tree structure the 3D scene can easily be rendered mantaining each object position relative to parent / child.
  Keep in mind that the model matrix (matrix for local transformation) can accumulate the result of many transformations, 
  this transformations apply to the hierarchy of parent and children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Model Matrix</p>

    <p>It stores the current location, orientation and scale of a ‘gameObject’. The aculmulated transformations end up stored within the matrix data.
  Why is so important? The global positions of any of the mesh vertices that may actually be rendered won’t be stored,
  they are calculated based on the object model matrix every frame when they need to be rendered on screen.
  Have a look at the diferent matrices operations that can take within the object local / global transformations:
  <a href="https://waloncab.github.io/s.ln_blog/posts/matrix_transformations.html">Matrix Transformations for Rendering 3D Objects</a></p>

    <p>When transforming a set of points with a matrix:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>points are multiplied by the matrix in the vertex shader</li>
      <li>new coordinates are passed along to the fragment shader</li>
      <li>new coordinates of the points are not permantently stored</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>2023-07-24-0_bezier_PLL Introduction¶ In this publication, we are going to understand how general Bézier curves are created, and we'll implement different parallel algorithms to make them run faster. The aim of this post is to handle general curves, that means that we need the mathematical tools to create them. You may...</p>

	NeRF proposes an ingenious way to synthesize novel views of a scene by modelling the volumetric scene function through a neural network. 
	The network learns to model the volumetric scene, thus generating novel views (images) of the 3D scene that the model was not shown at training time.
